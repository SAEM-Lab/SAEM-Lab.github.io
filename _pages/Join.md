# Join Us

We are actively recruiting motivated students and post-doctoral researchers.
Experience with computational methods (Python / coding, machine learning, DFT...) is certainly a plus, but not required – just a willingness to learn and a passion for research!
(Seán had no experience before his PhD and he somehow became a professor).
Some knowledge in the physical sciences (chemistry, physics, materials science, maths) is also beneficial, but again not a dealbreaker and we are happy to train you in the necessary background.

We have built a comprehensive internal wiki and accompanying set of group resources (code & video tutorials, condensed notes and walkthroughs) to help you get up to speed quickly, while Seán and other group members are committed to mentoring you through your growth as an independent researcher.
We are a friendly and inclusive group, and we welcome students from all backgrounds.
<!-- We have a weekly group meeting where we discuss ongoing projects, share ideas, and provide feedback.  -->
<!-- This collaborative environment ensures that you are never alone in your research and that help is always available when you need it. -->

<!-- Should add a group photo here once we have one! -->

As mentioned on our [Research](/research.html) page, we work on a variety of topics in computational materials science, with a focus on energy materials and machine learning. We are particularly interested in projects that involve the development of new computational methods or the application of existing methods to solve challenging problems in materials science.
Gives a flavour of what we do, but we are always open to new ideas and approaches, so if you have a specific project in mind that you would like to work on, please feel free to reach out.

You can reach out to Seán via email (sk2045[at]cam.ac.uk), and it is helpful to include a brief description of your background, a CV and any relevant experience, to help determine potential research projects.

**Should have a photo of me somewhere!**

## Fellowships
We are extremely supportive of students applying for external fellowships to fund their research, and we have a strong track record of success in this area. If you are interested in applying for a fellowship, please reach out to Seán to discuss potential projects and application strategies.


## Post-Doctoral Researchers


Many of the undergraduate students I have mentored have won research awards (thesis prize, NSF GRFP, MIT poster award) and have co-authored papers in top venues (e.g. ICML 2021, RECOMB/Cell Systems 2022, RECOMB 2024/Nature Methods 2025).
