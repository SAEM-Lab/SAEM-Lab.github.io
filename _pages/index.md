# Welcome to the **Simulation of Advanced Materials** (SAM) Lab at the University of Cambridge!

## What We Do
We are a research team in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, using <u>state-of-the-art computational methods to design and develop next-generation materials</u>; primarily targeting energy applications. 

We work at the intersection of materials science, chemistry, physics and artificial intelligence (AI); developing and deploying techniques from quantum chemistry (e.g. DFT), solid-state physics and machine learning (ML) to understand the atomic-level properties of materials.
Using our insights from these calculations, run on massive high-performance computers, we predict, design and optimise the performance of materials in real-world technologies. 

The team is led by Dr. Se√°n Kavanagh, and is part of the vibrant materials modelling community at Cambridge, including the [Lennard Jones Centre](https://ljc.group.cam.ac.uk/).

### TODOs:
- Stats counter
- Photo from a conference could be nice (in recent highlights?)
- Fig 3.6 from Thesis perhaps, doped carrier concentration heatmaps... Split vacancies figure maybe
- Want to link codes, to get a flavour of what we do (In research?). Could maybe have a separate Codes page like Alex? Stuff from doped/SnB docs sites could be nice, like SnB gif etc
- Likewise, YouTube
- Re-run through and make more succinct
- Update links on SAM Lab github and description, add link to website at top of README.
- Link on kavanase website etc
- Update our socials descriptions
- Update commonninja image URL

### Ideal TODOs:
- Style etc; after content. I'd like a different font, like Alex's site.
- Eye-catching image -- something that makes it look cool but accessible?
