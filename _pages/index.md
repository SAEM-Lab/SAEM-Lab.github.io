# Welcome to the **Simulation of Advanced Materials** (SAM) Lab at the University of Cambridge!

## What We Do
We are a research team in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, using <u>state-of-the-art computational methods to design and develop next-generation materials</u>; primarily targeting energy applications. 

We work at the intersection of materials science, chemistry and physics; developing and deploying techniques from quantum chemistry (e.g. DFT), solid-state physics and machine learning to understand the atomic-level properties of materials.
Using our insights from these calculations, run on massive high-performance computers, we predict, design and optimise the performance of materials in real-world technologies. 

The team is led by Dr. Se√°n Kavanagh, and is part of the vibrant materials modelling community at Cambridge, including the [Lennard Jones Centre](https://ljc.group.cam.ac.uk/).

**Eye-catching image like Aron, perhaps -- something that makes it look cool but accessible?**

## Interested in joining the SAM Lab?
We are actively looking for motivated students and postdocs! 
Check out our current [Research](Research) interest areas, and the [Join](Join) page if you are interested in being part of the team.

### Recent Highlights
[//]: # (put Cambridge announcement post here when ready)

TODO: LinkedIn/Twitter widget here?

### TODOs:
- LinkedIn/Twitter widget
- Photo from a conference could be nice
- Fig 3.6 from Thesis perhaps, doped carrier concentration heatmaps... Split vacancies figure maybe
- Want to link codes, to get a flavour of what we do (In research?). Could maybe have a separate Codes page like Alex? Stuff from doped/SnB docs sites could be nice, like SnB gif etc
- Likewise, YouTube
- Style etc; after content. I'd like a different font, like Alex's site.
