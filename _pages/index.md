# Welcome to the **Simulation of Advanced Energy Materials** (SAEM) Lab at the University of Cambridge!

## What We Do
We are a research team in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, using <u>state-of-the-art computational methods to design and develop next-generation materials</u>; primarily targeting energy applications. 
We work at the intersection of materials science, chemistry and physics; developing and deploying techniques from quantum chemistry (e.g. DFT), solid-state physics and machine learning to understand the atomic-level properties of materials.
Using our insights from these calculations, run on massive high-performance computers, we predict, design and optimise the performance of materials in real-world technologies.

The team is led by Dr. Se√°n Kavanagh, and is part of the vibrant materials modelling community at Cambridge, including the [Lennard Jones Centre](https://ljc.group.cam.ac.uk/).

## Interested in joining the SAEM Lab?
We are actively looking for motivated students and postdocs! 
Check out our current [Research](#research) interest areas, and the [Join](#join) page if you are interested in being part of the team.

- Pre-commit spellcheck, anything else?
- Want to link codes, to get a flavour of what we do. 
- Likewise, YouTube
- Style etc; after content
