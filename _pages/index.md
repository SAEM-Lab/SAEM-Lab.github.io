# Welcome to the **Simulation of Advanced Materials** (SAM) Lab at the University of Cambridge!

## What We Do
We are a research team in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, using <u>state-of-the-art computational methods to design and develop next-generation materials</u>; primarily targeting energy applications. 

We work at the intersection of materials science, chemistry, physics and artificial intelligence (AI); developing and deploying techniques from quantum chemistry (e.g. DFT), solid-state physics and machine learning (ML) to understand the atomic-level properties of materials.
Using our insights from these calculations, run on massive high-performance computers, we predict, design and optimise the performance of materials in real-world technologies.

The team is led by Dr. Se√°n Kavanagh, and is part of the vibrant materials modelling community at Cambridge, including the [Lennard Jones Centre](https://ljc.group.cam.ac.uk/).

## Interested in joining the SAM Lab?
We are actively looking for motivated students and postdocs! 
Check out our current [Research](Research) interest areas, and the [Join](Join) page if you are interested in being part of the team.

## Recent Highlights
Travelling to conferences to present and discuss ideas with other researchers, with time to be a tourist and explore, is one of the best parts of the job. From Psi-K 2025:

### TODOs:
- Stats counter
- Re-run through and make more succinct
- Update links on SAM Lab github and description, add link to website at top of README.
- Link on kavanase website etc
- Update our socials descriptions

### Ideal TODOs:
- Style etc; after content. I'd like a different font, like Alex's site.
- Eye-catching image -- something that makes it look cool but accessible? Happy with what we have?
  - Fig 3.6 from Thesis perhaps, doped carrier concentration heatmaps... Split vacancies figure maybe
