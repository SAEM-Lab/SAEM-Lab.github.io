We lead and contribute to the development of a range of computational packages to support our research, primarily based in Python.
These computational tools are open-source and are used by thousands of other researchers worldwide.
Code development is not a requirement in our group, but it can be a great way to build and showcase highly-desired skills, while greatly accelerating our research and benefitting the global research community.

We aim to produce code that is simultaneously powerful and user-friendly, to maximise impact.
These include:

## [`doped`](https://doped.readthedocs.io)

</a>

`doped` is a comprehensive Python suite for the generation and analysis of defect calculations, implementing the defect simulation workflow in an efficient, reproducible, user-friendly yet powerful and fully-customisable manner.

</a>

 `ShakeNBreak` is a defect structure-searching method (i.e. global optimisation strategy) employing chemically-guided bond distortions to locate ground-state and metastable structures of defects in solid materials. 

## [`NequIP`](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) & [`Allegro`](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/projects/allegro/en/latest/)
<a href="https://nequip.readthedocs.io">

</a>
`NequIP` is an open-source code for building equivariant graph neural network (GNN) interatomic potentials (i.e. machine-learned force fields; MLFFs), which has inspired several other community codes in this area. See the [matbench-discovery leaderboard](https://matbench-discovery.materialsproject.org/) for inorganic material foundation models.

`Allegro` is an extension to `NequIP`, which implements a strictly-local GNN architecture to facilitate simulations of millions of atoms üöÄ

## [`PyTASER`](https://pytaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

``PyTASER`` is a ``Python`` library for simulating differential absorption spectra in compounds using
quantum chemical calculations, including transient (TAS) and differential (DAS) absorption spectroscopies.

## [`easyunfold`](https://smtg-bham.github.io/easyunfold/)
`easyunfold` implements electronic band structure unfolding, which is a technique for obtaining the effective band structure of symmetry-broken systems, such as disordered / defective / alloyed / thermally-active materials.
