# Codes

We lead and contribute to the development of a range of computational packages to support our research, primarily based in Python.
These computational tools are open-source and are used by thousands of other researchers worldwide.
Code development is not a requirement in our group, but it can be a great way to build and showcase highly-desired skills, while greatly accelerating our research and benefitting the global research community.
We aim to produce code that is simultaneously powerful and user-friendly, to maximise impact.

These include:

## [`doped`](https://doped.readthedocs.io)
<a href="https://doped.readthedocs.io">

</a>

`doped` is a comprehensive Python suite for the generation, pre-/post-processing and analysis of defect calculations, implementing the defect simulation workflow in an efficient, reproducible, user-friendly yet powerful and fully-customisable manner.

## [`ShakeNBreak`](https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io)

</a>

 `ShakeNBreak` is a defect structure-searching method (i.e. global optimisation strategy) employing chemically-guided bond distortions to locate ground-state and metastable structures of defects in solid materials. Click the image to check out the docs site!

## [`NequIP`](https://nequip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
**Image? Could do logo, but architecture maybe better**

</a>
`NequIP` is an open-source code for building equivariant graph neural network (GNN) interatomic potentials (i.e. machine-learned force fields; MLFFs).
<!-- link matbench discovery perhaps -->
It is a highly flexible and extensible architecture, which has inspired several other community codes in this area.

## [`Allegro`](https://nequip-allegro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
**Update links!**
**Image? Could do logo, but architecture maybe better**
<a href="https://allegro.readthedocs.io">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mir-group/nequip-allegro/main/docs/logo.png">
</a>
`Allegro` is an extension to `NequIP`, which implements a strictly-local GNN architecture without the use of message-passing to facilitate highly-scalable simulations (on up to a trillion atoms!).

## [`PyTASER`](https://pytaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
<a href="https://pytaser.readthedocs.io">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WMD-Group/PyTASER/main/docs/PyTASER.png">
</a>
``PyTASER`` is a ``Python`` library for simulating differential absorption spectra in compounds using
quantum chemical calculations, including transient (TAS) and differential (DAS) absorption spectroscopies.

## [`easyunfold`](https://smtg-bham.github.io/easyunfold/)
`easyunfold` implements electronic band structure unfolding, which is a technique for obtaining the effective band structure of symmetry-broken systems, such as disordered/defective/alloyed/thermally-active materials.

**TODO: See what Alex etc did**

We also contribute to a number of community codes, including:
- [`pymatgen`]()
- [`ase`]()
- [`CarrierCapture.jl`]()
- [`TrapLimitedConversion`]()
- ...
